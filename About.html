Wilson Memorial for Distinction in the Spanish Major for her Senior Honor’s Thesis, “The Critique of Christian Charity in the Medieval Spanish World of La Celestina by Fernando de Rojas”, in which she analyzed the emergence of a new society in Renaissance Spain, which was straying away from traditional medieval attitudes of kindness and goodwill to others and instead focusing on the mercantile sentiment of viewing the world with the aim of self-profit. She has primarily worked in the fields of Bilingual (Spanish) Education and Customer Service for the past 4 years, and privately tutors students in Spanish, English/Literature, and History. Shreya is excited to be a part of the SASteam, and looks forward to using her writing abilities, knowledge of intercultural sensibilities, and linguistic proficiency to inspire others to view the world as more than the sum of its individual communities.

          <div id="act-1-info-ext">The logistics of the program was very well planned and immaculately executed by the Centurion staff and faculty. Centurion was excited to have us, the UCSC students and faculty on the campus. They put us in their guesthouse meant for the distinguished visitors and arranged our food to our taste in a very clean and hygienic surrounding. They had appointed one full-time assistant and a cleaning staff to ensure that everything ran smoothly to our satisfaction. The classes were held in their poolside hall and was fully air conditioned. The class was well equipped with modern technology. As you can see from the student’s evaluations, our students enjoyed all the presentations on the campus and learned a great deal from their visits to various skill centers run by the University. The excursions were the highlight of our time spent here at Centurion. The students appreciated them to learn about the culture, heritage and traditions of India. They could not have enough of them. Many students expressed the interest to have more excursions in order to have a more enriching experience in India.

          <div id="act-1-title">Student Testimonies</div>
          <div id="act-1-info">I knew the basics of the skill training of Centurion University, but wanted more in-depth information. Working directly with the Paramedic and Allied Health Sciences I realized that the students are as eager to learn as the lecturers to teach. What I will take back with me to the US is the genuine and sincere minds the students have in and out of the classroom. I am leaving inspired to work hard and smart like the students here, past any obstacle I face. I’d like more students (from the US) to come and live this experience first-hand.

          <div id="act-1-info">Meeting the hearing impaired in the Café Coffee Day (CCD) lab has left a deep impression on me. They made me feel positive and inspired. I think I feel ore inspired to be involved in my field because my plans aligns to what CCD lab does, which is preparing and counseling differently abled students for success in life. I want to see if I can have the opportunity to talk to Los Angeles Unified School District to bring back public vocational training. The visibility of blue collar jobs is something we need to do the US and I want to work in that.

          <div id="act-1-info">I was very impressed that there is so much diversity in the programs offered to students, who are also from very diverse backgrounds. To have so much on one Campus is quite remarkable. I like all the skill based training and placement the students receive. I think it would be a good idea to have more time; 5 weeks is not enough to truly understand the diversity of the programs in Centurion University.
